# Privacy Policy

Last updated: **2026-02-01**

This Privacy Policy explains how **[APP_NAME]** (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.

If you have any questions, contact us at: **[SUPPORT_EMAIL]**

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### a) Location Data (Optional)
The App may use your device location **only if you grant permission**, to support core features such as saving and finding your parked car location.

- **Precise location** may be used for accurate parking location saving and navigation.
- You can disable location access at any time in **iOS Settings**.

### b) User Content
The App may store information you create inside the App such as:
- saved parking spots (coordinates / address)
- notes (if you use notes)

This information is stored **on your device** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### c) Purchases (Subscriptions)
If you purchase a subscription, purchase information is handled by **Apple’s App Store**.
We do not collect or store your full payment details (such as credit card information).

The App uses **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions and entitlements (e.g., whether “Pro” is active). RevenueCat may process:
- purchase events
- subscription status / entitlement state
- device-related identifiers needed to provide the service

---

## 2. How We Use Information

We use information only to:
- provide the App’s core functionality (save / locate your car)
- enable Pro features (if subscribed)
- restore purchases (when you tap “Restore Purchases”)
- improve stability and performance (error handling, app reliability)

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We do **not sell** your personal data.

We may share limited data with:
- **Apple App Store** (to process subscriptions and payments)
- **RevenueCat** (to verify purchases and manage entitlements)

These services process data under their own privacy policies:
- Apple: App Store & Apple services privacy policies
- RevenueCat: RevenueCat privacy policy

---

## 4. Tracking & Advertising
The App does **not** use data for cross-app tracking or advertising purposes unless clearly disclosed in App Store privacy details and within the App.

If tracking is ever enabled, the App will request permission through **Apple’s App Tracking Transparency** prompt.

---

## 5. Data Retention
- Saved locations and related app data are kept on your device until you delete them or remove the App.
- Subscription status data is maintained as needed to provide Pro access and restore purchases.

---

## 6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

---

## 7. Your Choices
You can:
- disable location permission in iOS Settings
- delete saved spots within the App (if the App offers delete)
- uninstall the App to remove locally stored data
- manage or cancel subscriptions in iOS:
  **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date.
